# Character-wise-RNN

## Description:
 I constructed a character-level LSTM with PyTorch. The network used to train character by character on some text, then generate new text character by character. As an example, I trained on Anna Karenina (Novel). This model will be able to generate new text based on the text from the book! You can see the whole project through this [link](https://mosaabmuhammed.github.io/Character-wise-RNN/Character_Level_RNN_Solution.html).

## Note:
This project was one of the project in Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.
